# Functions_and_Errors_ETH-AVAX 
In this I am creating a smart contract following the guidelines of module 1 of the project requirements.
Functionality
1. Contract successfully uses require()
2. Contract successfully uses assert()
3. Contract successfully uses revert() statements
   
## Description
Here I have created smart contract named modulefirst which is demonstrating the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements.

### Code execution
For executing the code i have used remix ide [https://remix.ethereum.org/].

### Code Explanation
The `ModuleFirst` Solidity contract employs `require`, `assert`, and `revert` for error handling and input validation. `assignNum` validates non-zero and positive inputs, `assertSample` checks equality, and `revertSample` explicitly reverts transactions based on conditions. These mechanisms enhance contract robustness by enforcing preconditions and ensuring expected behavior, critical for secure smart contract development.![image](https://github.com/Soyam2405/Functions_and_Errors_ETH-AVAX/assets/120269736/a140400d-2358-43e4-a2e8-ec23ad87526f)

#### Execution steps on remix ide online
1. Firstly compile the written code on the remix ide.

2. Secondly check the version of solidity compiler must ensure it will be as per the code

3. Then deploy the code and test the reults under deploy and transcations field.
